# Celebi
There are many instances you would wanna restore a database. But what to do when the restore process
is tedious and time consuming because, lets face it, those backup files are giganormous and no one wants
to spend 2 daily hours simple restoring a temporal database for a remaining 6 hours workday, just to go on
and do all over again tomorrow, this is 2021!

Celebi is the autopilot for database restoration processes. As of right now it is powershell and sql based, but there are plans to expand to other platfroms and databases. With Celebi, you can just schedule the restore of your database to happen at, say 1am, so when you are ready to work on those legacy system's bug again, the temporal database is already there for you to break and play with as much as you want without risk of (another) production bug.

Installation
------------
1. Clone this repo to whetever from whetever to want it to be executed
2. Modify the `config.json` configurations file as required [Read more](docs/Configuration)
3. Run the `Install.ps1`
4. Enjoy

Usage
-----
Under the hood Celebi sets up a scheduled task pointing to the actual restore script. So whenever you wanna make a change to the configuration file, you just need to do that, there is no need for additional steps.<br>
After running the restore celebi leaves the powershell terminal open for the next time you log on into your machine, get a notice and a brief review of the restore process.
